	 Medellín is a city where you can find opportunities for everything.
	 Next month, everyone has the opportunity to accept a new challenge, The Medellín-La Estrella race!

	 The mayor’s office always promotes using environmentally friendly vehicles and having healthy habits, 
	 the best way to promote both is doing a bike race.<br>
	 <q>This way we help the environment, have healthy habits and we can have fun with our friends and family, 
	 I usually go with my wife and sons!
	 I invite you all, Metropolitan Area, to be part of the biggest bike race you will ever see!</q> This is what the mayor 
	 said when the race was announced. Every year hundreds of people sign up to these races, 
	 but this year we’ll see the biggest race in Medellín history, so large that the race goes all through the Metropolitan Area.

   <h3>But, where is going to go?</h3>
   <p>
     The race will start at the Botanical Garden, will pass through Botero Square, 
	 River Parks and then through avenue 63 to arrive at the south highway; to finish the race 
	 the participants have to get to the end of the highway, enter La Estrella and get to its main park.
