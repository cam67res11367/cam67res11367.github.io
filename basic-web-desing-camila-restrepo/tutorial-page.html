		<h1>How to embed a video</h1>
		<p>Have you ever wanted to put a video on your website? Then here you are going to learn how! </br>
		   Let's start!
		</p>
		<section class="container">
		    <div><span class="no">1.</span>To start we need our basic html file structure:<br/>
			     <img src="images/starter.png" alt="Shortcut of the starter page in Notepas++" width="500px"></div>
			    
			<div><span class="no">2.</span> Now we have to put the tag that will let us embed a video:<br/>
			     <img src="images/iframe.png" alt="Same as the last image but with the <iframe> tag." width="500px"><br/>
				 This isn't a void element, and is wrote as "&lt;iframe&gt;" to open it.</div>
			   
			<div><span class="no">3.</span>This step is really important, here is where you give to the browser the instruction of wich video present from the web:<br/>
			     <img src="images/source.png" alt="Same as the last image but with source property" width="500px"><br/>
				    In this case we are using a youtube video from the chanal "Kurzgesagt-In a nutshell", called "What is the inteligence?".</div>
			   
			<div><span class="no">4.</span>For the layout desing, we need to set what size do we want the video to be shown:<br/>
			    <img src="images/size.png" width="500px"><br/>
			    If you noticed there's also the property of "title" here you must put, forgive the repetition, the title of the video.</div>
			 
			<div><span class="no">5. </span>And for the final touch, we need to close the tag with "&lt;/iframe&gt;" :<br/> 
			     <img src="images/end.png" width="500px"></div>
			   
		</section>
		<p>And now you are done! This is how the video will display:</p>
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ck4RGeoHFko?si=BOHGQ6NhaEOAwYtA" 
		 height="310px" width="560px" title="What is inteligence?"></iframe>
